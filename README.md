# Bot-Telegram
Telelram bot for final project of python course
____

# Introduction
We created this bot to ~~pass the course~~ develop our programming skills. This project is a simulation of the game "Bulls and Cows" (:water_buffalo: and :cow2:), allowing users to play with our bot through telegram :smiley:

# Rules of the game
The rules of the game are simple: 
One player thinks of a number, while the other player tries to guess it.
The number guessed must be a 4 digit number, using only digits from 1-9.
Each digit can only be used once.
If the digits in the number are in their right position, they are "bulls", if different "cows"
Digits not part

# How it works?

### First step
